[00:00.33] (When our children ask us how did we meet)

[00:06.25] (FYP love, IG love}
[00:15.75] 
[00:12.99] My crisis ain't from cost of living
[00:14.54] I think bout death like God forbid it
[00:16.19] American Express got no limit
[00:17.68] Career consists of lots of women
[00:33.68] 
[00:19.28] How can I convince you I'm not the villain
[00:20.88] Shits dramatic like opera singing
[00:22.40] Down on one knee, I got a proposition
[00:24.03] In the past I was not consistent
[00:40.03] 
[00:25.67] Out of these girls you're top division
[00:27.26] Can't downgrade and lower my standard
[00:28.86] Went I first saw you on the gram bae
[00:30.61] I was in awe and showing the mandem
[00:32.04] Asking advice, how can I slide in there?
[00:33.62] Using words not my usual language
[00:35.18] I clocked that you just came out of a break up
[00:36.92] Been on ur social media ranting
[00:38.45] Slid up and replied to your story
[00:40.08] You ain't responded I wanna unsend it
[00:58.58] 
[00:42.43] Got me stalking your Facebook page
[00:43.99] And preeing your friends list
[00:45.05] Saw that you followed a fellow acquaintance
[00:46.56] You ain't even mine yet, I'm feeling envious
[00:48.31] Promiscuous chick make me wanna risk it
[00:50.08] I like how you're real uncensored
[01:06.58] 
[00:51.67] When our children ask us how did we meet
[00:53.29] I'm telling them gen z love
[00:54.51] FYP love, IG love
[00:56.10] Saw her on the explore page
[00:57.52] Like I need to, explore deeper
[00:59.09] Suggested accounts said that we got mutuals
[01:01.06] But you don't fuck with them, me neither
[01:02.52] When I'm with you I get baby fever
[01:03.93] I met your mum on the FYP
[01:05.75] We're young and our luv's Gen Z
[01:07.10] Mum said that it ain't gon last
[01:09.01] I'm telling her we gon see
[01:10.34] They say our relationship is childish
[01:12.20] You're my baby, so I agree
[01:13.74] Started with a IG like
[01:15.22] Now you're down to ride just like a G
[01:33.72] 
[01:17.17] If it weren't for the algorithm
[01:18.61] I wouldn't have found my woman
[01:20.23] We're messing around and acting like kids, give me a nostalgic feeling
[01:23.62] Took you on all of 'em trips
[01:25.03] Now you got my account untrippin'
[01:26.61] Sent you a thousand roses
[01:27.94] Not like you're local, a thousand of miles I've driven
[01:30.08] You ain't even gave me the ick yet
[01:31.30] I ain't even seen red flags yet
[01:33.18] Get mad 'n you call me a dickhead
[01:34.58] Got me addicted, feel like a crackhead
[01:36.35] Passenger seat, just giving me side eye
[01:37.74] It's giving main character syndrome
[01:39.39] You ain't got to connect to the Wi-Fi
[01:40.94] Let's just talk and put down our iPhones
[01:42.71] She like my post, I like her post
[01:44.19] Love at first sight, love at first row
[01:45.55] I ain't perfect, I'm trynna learn though
[01:47.32] Hope it's worth it when we turn old
[01:48.72] Still recovering, I'm not okay
[01:50.24] So I'm paranoid that she won't stay
[01:51.98] I'mma catch you wine, this a soul train
[01:53.64] I'm afraid this ain't like the old days
[02:13.14]
